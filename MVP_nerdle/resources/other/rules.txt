Guess the NERDLE in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the solution. Watch a video.

Each guess is a calculation.
You can use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + - * / or =.
It must contain one “=”.
It must only have a number to the right of the “=”, not another calculation.
Standard order of operations applies, so calculate * and / before + and - eg. 3+2*5=13 not 25!

If your guess includes, say, two 1s but the answer has only one, you will get one color tile and one black.

Tiles will only go green if the number is in the correct position or when a full guess is rearranged as a winning commutative answer.
