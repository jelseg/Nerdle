The goal of NERDLE is to guess the digits and operation characters of a mathematical equation.

There are 5 types of difficulties:
    * super easy: 8 tries, 6 characters, + -
    * easy: 6 tries, 6 characters, + - x /
    * normal: 6 tries, 8 characters, + - x /
    * hard: 6 tries, 10 characters, + - x /
    * modulus: 6 tries, 6 characters, + - x / %

Each guess must contain one "=", you can have an equation on both sides of the "="
Standard order of operations applies, so calculate * and / before + and - eg. 3+2*5=13 not 25!

After each guess the game will calculate how well you are doing and change the different tiles accordingly:
    * black: character does not appear in the solution
    * purple: character does appear in the solution, but on another spot
    * green: character appears in the equation and is on the correct spot

If your guess includes, say, two 1s but the answer has only one, you will get one color tile and one black.

Good luck!
